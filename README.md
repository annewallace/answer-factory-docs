# AnswerFactory documentation
Documentation, guides, and help for AnswerFactory.

##The Basics
###What is AnswerFactory?
AnswerFactory is a simple web-based interface that allows ANYONE to take advantage of the power of GBDX and cloud-based remote sensing at scale (without needing to know what any of that means!).<br>

The goal of AnswerFactory is making the power of answers and insights available to anyone so your organization and enterprise applications can benefit from actionable answers delivered easily and automatically for areas important to your business.

###What does it do?
AnswerFactory allows you to create projects containing areas or regions of the globe you care about, then add "answers" within those areas to do things including locating and counting objects, detecting change, identifying foliage, finding OpenStreetMaps (OSM) new features, etc.<br>

We're adding new "answers" to AnswerFactory almost every two weeks and update our ["What's New"](https://github.com/DigitalGlobe/answer-factory/blob/master/new-features.md) page as soon as we do.

###How do I access AnswerFactory?
[Production Environment Login](https://vector.geobigdata.io/answer-factory) - requires login using your GBDX username and password<br>

[Development Environment Login](https://devvector.geobigdata.io/answer-factory) - requires login using your GBDX username and password

#####Don't have a GBDX username and password?
You can register for a GBDX Eval Account [here](https://gbdx.geobigdata.io/account/self_registration/)! Select "Product Evaluation" as "Intended Use".<br>

Our Production Environment runs the latest versions of the stable "answers" and feature sets within AnswerFactory. Our Development Server has "answers" and features currently under development.
